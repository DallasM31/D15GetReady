                <p>Good-bye 2020 and Hello 2021! Happy New Year everyone!</p>
                <p>I have been reading Rick Heyland’s book “Live Your Purpose” and Simon Sinek’s book “Find your Why” which was a follow-up to his book “Start with Why”. Hope you get where I am going with this. We need to find our <bold>WHY</bold> for emergency preparedness before it will become important to us. It may be the feeling you had when you experienced the recent earthquake along the Wasatch front. Or maybe the wind storm, or maybe the protests and riot of recent. Or maybe the election didn’t quite turnout the way you had hoped. Or maybe you felt the spirit as our Church leaders shared in the last conference the importance of preparedness. For whatever reason, it will not be important to you until you find your why.</p>
                <p>Funny thing is, it has been important to me for about the last 20 years. To the point my family kind of thinks I am paranoid, which I am not, I just like being prepared. It probably stems from my many adventures in young men's backpacking and camping. I loved the idea I could survive for a week with everything on my back and what nature can share with me. The feeling of being self-reliant in extreme situations is energizing for me. That’s probably why I have so many backpacking and preparedness books in my library. They give me new ideas of how I can become even more prepared. Please consider me one of the many resources in the ward who can help you prepare for the unknown future.</p>
                <p>In President Nelson’s 2020 October Relief Society Meeting talk "Embrace the Future with Faith", he asked “If preparation is our key to embracing this dispensation and our future with faith, how can we best prepare?” And then the answer “For decades, the Lord’s prophets have urged us to store food, water, and financial reserves for a time of need. The current pandemic has reinforced the wisdom of that council. I urge you to take steps to be temporally prepared. But I am even more concerned about your spiritual and emotional preparations.” I would encourage everyone to re-read or listen to this talk. </p>

                  February 2021 - Personal Preparedness Assessment

                <h3>A Personal Preparedness Assessment</h3>
                <p>President Thomas S Monson shared "Many more people could ride out the storm-tossed waves in the economic lives if they had their year's supply of food… and were debt free. Today we find that many have followed this counsel in reverse : they have at least a year's supply of debt and are food-free."</p>
                <p>"Noah heeded God's command to build the ark… that they might be aved from the floodwaters… Yet there was no evidence of rain and flood… His actions were considered irrational… The sun was shining and life moved forward as usual. But time ran out… The flood came, the disobedient were drowned.. When God speaks and we obey, we will always be right" <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2007/10/they-marked-the-path-to-follow?lang=eng">Ensign 2007-10 They Marked the Path to Follow</a></p>
                <h4>How Prepared Are We Really?</h4>
                <p>A common trap we fall into from time to time is believing nothing bad will happen to us and thinking we are more prepared than we actually are. It’s important to recognize though that just because you have 6 months of food and water stored doesn’t mean you’re prepared for 6 months. It may be a good start, but there are just too many other areas of preparedness, and too many variables that could derail your plans.</p>
                <p>If you are just starting out, the odds are that you are not giving yourself enough credit. Often, as we begin to learn more about being prepared, we get the feeling we are very unprepared. But with time, you will probably find you are more prepared than you thought, and can feel more confident about your situation.</p>
                <p>Whether you are just getting starting your preparedness journey, or have been at it a while, doing a personal assessment is basically the same. As a matter of fact, it may be a little easier at first because you don’t have as much. Here are a few ideas about assessing your preparedness plans:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li><b>List Your Priorities:</b> Our priorities will change over time. This could be because of current events, our abilities to deal with emergencies can change as we mature, or changes occur in our family structure. As we learn new skills and our preparedness level changes, our priorities may change as well.</li>
                  <li><b>List Your Strength and Weaknesses:</b> This is especially important as you are starting out, but also important for seasoned preppers. As our age, family structure and preparedness experience changes, so do our strengths and weaknesses.</li>
                  <li><b>List Your Concerns:</b> As time goes by, and different problems arise around the world, our concerns are bound to change. It’s important to reprioritize their importance. </li>
                  <li><b>Preparedness Not Fear:</b> As we prepare we need to focus on what we can control, and not get consumed by the things we can’t. We can’t control what is going on behind the scenes, but we can control how we react and prepare for it.</li>
                  <li><b>Create a Prioritized Plan:</b> Take your list of weaknesses and prioritize them. Focus on your biggest weaknesses first and master them before you move on to the others. </li>
                  </ul>
                <p>To help you think of things for your plan, take a <a href="checklists/PersonalPreparednessAssessment.pdf">Personal Preparedness Survey</a>. It lists many things to consider and not in any specific order. If you need help with your plan, please feel free to reach out for help.</p>

                <p>New Orleans, Louisiana… San Francisco, California… Santiago, Chile… Sendai, Japan…</p>
                <p>These are all locations where a major disaster happened not too long ago and forced individuals and families to find shelter away from their homes. Have you ever given thought to what you would be able to grab if you had fifteen, or worse yet, five minutes to evacuate?</p>
                <p>Elder David A. Bednar talked about early warnings and being prepared in his April 2010 Conference Talk entitled Watching with All Perseverance.</p>
                <p><i>"Recently I was driving my car as drops of rain from a thunderstorm began to fall on the windshield. On the side of the road, an electronic sign displayed a timely warning: “Standing Water Ahead.” The surface on which I was driving appeared to be quite safe. But this vital information enabled me to prepare for a potential hazard I had not expected and could not yet see. As I continued toward my destination, I slowed down and watched carefully for additional signs of danger.</p>
                <p>We are blessed by spiritual early warning signals as a source of protection and direction in our lives. Consider the language of the Lord in the revelation known as the Word of Wisdom: “In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation” (D&C 89:4).</p>
                <p>Spiritual warnings should lead to increasingly vigilant watching. You and I live in “a day of warning” (D&C 63:58). And because we have been and will be warned, we need to be, as the Apostle Paul admonished, “watching . . . with all perseverance” (Ephesians 6:18)."</i></p>
                <p>While many of us may have some emergency supplies, food storage, and 72-hour kits ready and waiting, do we have important life-saving supplies and documents that can help us if needed in a crisis, ready at hand? Here are some examples (think no computer or cell phone working)…</p>
                <ul>Supplies:
                 <li>Emergency Funds (e.g. cash, coin, or silver)</li>
                 <li>Extra prescription medications</li>
                 <li>Extra glasses/contacts</li>
                 <li>Extra batteries</li>
                 <li>Scriptures</li>
                 <li>CB/GMRS/FRS/Ham radios (for communication)</li>
                 <li>Genealogy (family history) and journals</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>Documents:
                  <li>Emergency contacts</li>
                  <li>Family information</li> 
                  <li>Home and auto information (insurance, mortgage info, deed, titles)</li>
                  <li>Personal tax information</li>
                  <li>Financial information (personal accounts, credit cards, investments)</li>
                  <li>Personal possessions information</li>
                  <li>Pet information</li>
                  <li>Wills and trusts information</li>
                  <li>Emergency plans</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>During a disaster, emotions are high and it is hard to make sound decisions. I have many of these documents printed out and stored in a fire/waterproof lockbox next to my 72-hour bags. I sleep really good at night knowing my most important documents and a bug-out plan are all in one place waiting for the next crisis to happen and not relying on my frazzled brain reacting to a "standing water ahead" situation and forgetting something that could help prevent more frustration down the road.

              <h3>A Prepared Mind</h3>
              <p>An emergency, or even an unwanted event, could happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. When confronted with an unexpected situation, we have the potential to overcome those challenges, beat incredible odds, and come out a survivor. But just what is survival anyway? Survival is the art of surviving beyond any event. To survive means to remain alive; to fully live. Survival is taking a given circumstance, accepting it, and trying to improve it, while sustaining your life until you can get out of the situation. And most importantly, survival is a state of mind.</p>
              <p>Sisters Olaveson, Hayse, and Welker shared a message of preparedness in the February 2017 Ensign titled <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2017/02/ye-shall-not-fear?lang=eng" target="_blank"> Ye Shall Not Fear</a> and mentioned that "Physical preparedness is important in situations where access to life’s necessities—like food, water, and shelter—is limited. But mental and spiritual preparedness can be just as essential to emotional and physical survival."</p>
              <h5><b>When you prepare, you dramatically increase your chances for survival.</b></h5>
              <p>Neil L Andersen recently shared, "Spiritual preparation will uncover and bring to light your own inner resources. There is power in prayer. There is strength in the scriptures. We learn to step forward in faith and to be more fully obedient. Worthily preparing for and taking the sacrament each week renews and protects us. We receive the priceless gift of the Holy Ghost. This heavenly gift is real and absolutely essential to keeping us safe."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/neil-l-andersen/preparing-spiritual-destiny/" target="_blank"> Preparing for Your Spiritual Destiny - Neil L. Andersen - BYU Speeches</a></p>
              <p>Survival can come from many various situations including a loss of your home from fire or natural disasters, a personal financial downturn, a crisis in your family, or a death of a loved one. Regardless, a personal crisis can lead to someone feeling distressed and depressed. This kind of situation makes it hard to make reasonable and logical decisions. We often need to lean on others to help us survive. Regardless, preparing ourselves mentally and spiritually can help us manage our emotions and make good choices that can help us live in peace and happiness.</p>
              <p>Here are some tips on how you can fight to survive mentally in a hostile environment by keeping your priorities straight and not losing hope...</p>
              <p>Survival from any personal struggle or unexpected event depends a great deal on a person's ability to withstand stress in undesired situations. Your brain is without doubt your best survival tool. You most likely won't use your physical skills if you don't have a positive mental attitude (PMA).</p>
              <p>One definitely must be in the proper frame of mind to survive and thrive in an unplanned emergency situation. Attitude or psychological state is most certainly number one. It is undoubtedly the most important ingredient of survival. With the proper attitude, almost anything is possible.</p>
              <p>While in your emergency situation you will be confronted with many problems that you will need to overcome. Your brain will be your best asset but it could also be your most dangerous enemy. You will need to shift mental processes and adopt that positive and optimistic "can-do attitude". You will need to be creative and use your ability to improvise to adapt to the situation.</p>
              <p>Fear is a big enemy to guard against. Fear is a completely normal reaction for anyone faced with an out-of-the-ordinary situation that threatens important needs. There is no benefit in trying to avoid fear by denying the existence of a dangerous or difficult situation. You need to accept that fear is a natural reaction to difficult situations and try to make the best of your predicament.</p>
              <p>Keeping a positive mental outlook is for certain the most important aspect of survival. While in an emergency situation, you will want to practice self-reliance. Be sure to keep cool and collected. It is important to make the right decision at all times. Set your goal of survival and always keep it fresh in your mind. Never give up. Prepare for the worst but hope for the best.</p>
              <p>The SURVIVAL acronym the Army teaches soldiers who may be in difficult situations is:<br>
              S – Size up the situation<br>
              U – Use all your senses<br>
              R – Remember where you are<br>
              V – Vanquish fear and panic<br>
              I – Improvise<br>
              V – Value living<br>
              A – Act like the natives<br>
              L – Live by your wits<br>
              </p>
              <p>Mental preparedness for emergencies is very important. The Savior tells us, "…if ye are prepared ye shall not fear" <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.30?lang=eng&clang=eng#p30" target="_blank">(D&C 38:30)</a>. I am one of those who believes that you can never be 100% prepared, but you can be well prepared. A positive mental attitude is the first step. Making goals, lists while prioritizing and organizing will help you keep mentally prepared.</p>

              <h3>72 Hour Go Bags</h3>  
              <p>"We urge all Latter-day Saints to be prudent in their planning, to be conservative in their living, and to avoid excessive or unnecessary debt. Many more people could ride out the storm-tossed waves in their economic lives if they had a supply of food and clothing and were debt-free. Today we find that many have followed this counsel in reverse: they have a supply of debt and are food-free." <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2014/09/are-we-prepared?lang=eng">Thomas S. Monson Sep 2014 Are We Prepared? (churchofjesuschrist.org)</a></p>
              <p>One of the first things all of us can do is prepare for an unanticipated situation by having a 72-hour kit at the ready.</p>
              <p>To simplify making a 72-hour kit, you can divide "the mega-list" into 12 steps. There are so many resources for building a go-bag kit and everyone should consider what makes sense for them and their family. This is something everyone can complete and feel successful. You should prepare a portable kit for each member of your family. Consider preparing one for your place of work as well as one for children to keep at school and one for the car.</p>

              <p>Emergency Container Tip:<br>
              Create emergency kit(s) and store in any type of containers with wheels. Such as for the larger kits; garbage cans, foot-lockers, chest, duffle bags, tote bags, ice chest, various size suitcases or various size plastic boxes. A water-tight container is most ideal for keeping a 72-Hour Kit.</p>
              <p>Suggested Areas To Store Emergency Kit(s):<br>
              Store grab-and-go food and water container where easy to access in case you are devised to evacuate. Children and adults keep their emergency kit(s) in their bedrooms. Let the children have responsibility for their own backpack and have the older children buddy-up and take care of younger brothers or sisters. Mom, dad takes care of baby.<br>
              If a senior citizen resides with the family, also buddy-up and help them for they move slower and a backpack may be too heavy for them to carry. Do not forget house pets should also have emergency kits to be ready to grab-and-go. Pack the foods pet(s) normally eat, leashes, crates and litter box. Re-think where all of your camping gear is located throughout the household. Keep in one area if possible for easy access so you’re not looking in the dark with a flashlight for things. </p>
              <p>Bonus tip: Always keep a pair of hard sole shoes underneath your bed.<br>

                <p>As things are warming up and our water supply seems to be very thin, water may be an important and timely topic of discussion. Currently, the news is reporting of the heat wave we are experiencing and how all major reservoirs are very low. For the last two years our church leaders have asked the member to fast and pray for rain. Even our <a href= "https://ksltv.com/462192/utah-farmers-hit-hard-by-extreme-drought/?" target="_blank">state's political leaders </a> have asked all to pray and fast for a solution to our current water situation especially for our farmers.<br>
                Water is absolutely necessary for life. A person can live easily for one week without food and I have heard stories of people surviving weeks without food. However, without water, we will only live about three days. It is for this reason we should store some emergency water. We are very accustomed to abundant domestic supplies and we can hardly imagine water not being available - we take it for granted.<br>  
                An interruption from our water supply can happen because of many reasons. We often think about natural disasters or a broken pipe in the system, but we have recently seen local disruptions due to contamination. A good idea is to have a minimum of one week's worth of water stored for everyone in your home. <br>
                One gallon per person per day is the minimum that you should have in your emergency storage. This will give each person two quarts for drinking and two quarts for cleaning. Ideally, you would be better off with about double this amount. I have stored in my garage a 250  gallon water tank which would last four people about a month. That may seem like a lot but it sits quietly in the corner of my garage without taking up too much room.<br>   
                Hot weather can increase the amount of water we need. Children, and people who are ill, pregnant or nursing will need additional drinking water. Remember, our bodies are 60% water and we need to replenish the water leaving our bodies to stay hydrated. </p>
                <p><b>How much water should we store?</b><br>  
                As mentioned above, the minimum amount of water you should store is one gallon per person per day. Generally it takes a few days for emergency services to become available and water is the first staple provided. I would plan on a minimum of one week or minimally having seven gallons of water per person in storage.</p> 
                <p><b>What containers should be used?</b><br>  
                You should only store water in food-grade containers with tight fitting screw on caps. If you use containers from other food items like juice containers, you should wash them out with soap before storing water. It is best to use hard plastic or glass  containers as thinner containers such as those used to store milk or soda pop, are meant for short term use and will begin to decay relatively soon (glass may be more prone to break).<br>  
                Another option is large blue water storage containers. These are great to protect the water from sun light. You can find them at emergency preparedness stores or on KSL (<a href="https://classifieds.ksl.com/search/keyword/water%20barrels" target = "blank">Find water barrels For Sale | ksl.com </a>). We are going to do a group purchase for the month of July if anyone is interested - just let me know ($10 each).</p>  
                <p><b>What water should I use to store?</b><br>    
                The public water supply is chlorinated and is safe to store with no additional treatment. Adding additional chlorine or bleach is a personal preference. If you chose to add bleach only use product without scents, soaps, or colors. Use the following guidelines adding chlorine to your water storage…<br>  
                - Two drops bleach per quart    
                - Eight drops bleach per gallon
                - Two tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon for a 55 gallon drum
                - after adding gently stir and then let sit for 20-30 minutes before capping</p>
                <p><b>Where should I store water?</b><br>  
                Store your water in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Heat and light can break down the plastic containers. Also, best not to store water in close proximity to gasoline or pesticides as the vapors from these products can penetrate the plastic containers. Keep the storage containers off of cement (e.g. garage floor) as the water can damage the concrete and the concrete can be absorbed into the plastic and then into your water. Also strap water barrels to a wall in case of an earthquake. Consider adding to your calendar to rotate your water (drain and replace) at least every 5 years.</p>
